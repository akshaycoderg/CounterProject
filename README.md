Primitive Types & Conditionals | Cheat Sheet
1. JavaScript Values
Basically In JavaScript values are of two categories.

Primitive Types
Reference Types
1.1 Primitive Types
Number
Boolean
String
Undefined, etc.


Number	---All the numbers are of Number type.
Boolean	---Boolean values are either true or false.
String	--String is a stream of characters. The String should be enclosed with Single quotes, Double quotes, or Backticks.
Undefined	--If a value is not assigned to the variable, then it takes undefined as its value. In JS, undefined refers to the value that is not being assigned.

1.2 Operators
1.2.1 typeof()
The typeof() operator is used to find the type of value.

2. Converting String to a Number
In JavaScript, when we combine the number and string, it results in a string.

The parseInt() function accepts a string and converts it into an integer.


3. Conditional Statements
The Conditional Statement allows you to execute a block of code only when a specific condition is true.
